<li><strong>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;</strong></li>
<li><strong>A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the material; and</strong></li>
